If it is an executable it will run in a new shell.\r\n```\r\nThe package `open` is replacing the `opn` package, which is now deprecated. The older versions of `open` are vulnerable. \r\n\r\n**Note: Upgrading `open` to the last version will prevent this vulnerability but is also likely to have unwanted effects since it now has a very different API.**\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `open` to version 6.0.0 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/pwnall/node-open/issues/68)\n- [HackerOne Report](https://hackerone.com/reports/319473)\n- [NPM Security Advisory](https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/663)\n",
